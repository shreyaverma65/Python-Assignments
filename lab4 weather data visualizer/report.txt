1. Overview
This project analyzes real-world weather data from Delhi to understand temperature patterns, humidity relationships, and seasonal variations. Data was collected over several years and cleaned, processed, analyzed, and visualized using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. Key Insights from Analysis
Daily Statistics

Average temperature: varies between 15–30°C depending on the year

Minimum temperature: around 6°C

Maximum temperature: around 38°C

Standard deviation indicates moderate temperature variation

3. Monthly Patterns
Temperature rises from January to June

Hottest months: May–June (~33–35°C average)

Cooling phase begins around July (Monsoon)

Coldest months: December–January

4. Yearly Trends
Yearly averages mostly remain between 24°C to 27°C

A stable climatic pattern is observed with slight variations

5. Visualization Findings

Line chart clearly shows seasonal cycles repeating over years

Bar chart highlights temperature peaks around summer

Scatter plot shows an inverse relationship between humidity and temperature

Combined subplot helps compare trends side by side

6. Data Cleaning & Processing

Converted date column to datetime format

Checked for missing values

Removed NaN entries

Extracted month and year for grouping

7. Conclusion

The visualizations and statistics demonstrate clear seasonal weather patterns, strong temperature–humidity correlation, and yearly climatic consistency. The project showcases effective use of Python for real-world data analysis, cleaning, and storytelling.
